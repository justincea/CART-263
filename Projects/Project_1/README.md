Greedy by Justin Cea

For my first project, I decided to use both jQuery and jQuery UI to reflect the idea of Sisyphus’s affliction, where he executes a never-ending laborious task given by the Gods, specifically Zeus.
The reason I called this short mini game Greedy was mainly to include an interactive aspect that provokes the user to think he is succeeding at collecting all the coins when in reality they’re only facing deceit.

The way I chose to go by this was with the use of “coins” and “chests”. The user is convinced that the Gods (Zeus) reward them with the task to collect as many coins as they possibly can. The purpose of it all is to reveal the user’s greediness and show that it would be impossible to collect all coins, making it extremely frustrating. The way the game plays out is the user is required to drag the coins with the mouse into the chest in order to successfully collect a coin. While they collect the coins, random messages are called out to the user to encourage or question the user’s actions. After dragging all 5 coins into the chest, two remain “un-droppable”. Instead they revert to its initial position, forcing the user to enter this endless cycle of dragging the same coin without successfully dropping it in the chest.

In some ways, the feeling of excitement for collecting so many valuable things can tie itself down with the story of Sisyphus. That being said, Sisyphus' receives an analogous feeling of excitement that the user has when he reaches near the top of the mountain until he discovers that he can’t possibly accomplish his futile task of pushing an immense bolder up a hill.

Throughout the process, it was quite a challenge for me considering that I had no experience with HTML nor CSS, in some ways, it made it extra difficult for find my way through the making of this project. Additionally, starting up a new project from scratch was not of my comfort zone like last semester, it was new and interesting. Thankfully, with the prototype of the “Eat Up” activity we had done in class it really helped extend my knowledge and helped me conduct my own code using CSS, HTML and both jQuery and jQuery UI.

My favourite part about working on this project was working on the user’s interactions/actions. Making the user drag certain objects and dropping them into other objects was quite a fascinating experience. Most importantly the revert command that I learned from my peers was extremely fun to play with as well.

While this project remains simple, I believe its functionality, successfully reflects the idea of Sisyphus’ story in a metaphorical and creative way.
